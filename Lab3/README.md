## Reflection Questions
1. I encountered some issues with getting the Web apps to build, due to either accidentally missing a step, or for the fact that my repositories from lab 2 had the lab 1 code for some reason, which i promptly fixed.

2. It differs as they must be accessed and hosted in different ways, as the way they build is different to the vm's we used for rabbitMQ and the store front, making use of github's build and deploy rather than any native tools in their language, and their hosting differs as well, being more of an actual website link rather than just a public IP.

3. As I said in lab 2, the reason for this is because using environment variables allows for, in the vast majority of cases, cleaner code that's easier to modify, as you can simply change the environment variables rather than sifting through all of your code and modifying each part, as well as better security, as you can hide important security details from users using environment variables while still letting the app function.
